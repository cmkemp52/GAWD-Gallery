        Georgia Artists with DisAbilities, Inc. was founded in 1985, with a main
        goal to identify those disabled citizens of Georgia who are creative,
        capable, and talented in the arts, so that their achievements and
        talents can be recognized. There are many disabled artists in Georgia
        who have visions and dreams, but have no way of making it a reality. We
        help make it a reality for them.
        <h2>Our Mission Statement:</h2>
        <p>
          To provide mediums through which Georgia artists with dsabilities can
          display their artistic accomplishments to all disciplines of the arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create public awareness of the artistic skills that these artists
          developed by overcoming the obstacles of a disabvility.
